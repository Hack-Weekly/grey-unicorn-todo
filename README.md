Notes:

TodoItem needs to be camel cased ie: ToDoItem
can the local storage be abstracted into its on file?
what accessibility items need to be addressed? 
input box needs label element still?
the todo list needs titles?
need to address the typescript errors
still need an edit function 
the list items need check boxes instead of bullets

instead of TodoItemContainer.tsx being a component how about
it just becomes a className to manipulate for css
for now will just add a section the component
